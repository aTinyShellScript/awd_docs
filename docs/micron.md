# Micron Metal AB Drives
__Get these made at your own risk!__

NOTE: These are still in testing and will probably kick your dog and light your house on fire. 

__Get these made at your own risk!__

An offshoot of the AWD plates, this is just a shrunk down version to allow higher current to be run on Microns.

You can find the repo here: [https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/metal_micron](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/metal_micron)

## Printed Parts
You need to print all the bits in the STL folder.

## Metal Part Choices

- The 'stock' version uses ~3.2mm 5052 thick plates and printed z-belt retention pieces.
  - Alternatively, you can get these cut from 0.100"/2.54mm 5052 from SCS and have the belt retention pieces cut into the plates.
  - You can find the DXFs for these pieces [here](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/metal_micron/blob/main/DXF/Optional%20Alternative%20Parts/2.54mm_AB_Plate_Belt_Retention_%5Bx4%5D.dxf).
- 'Stock' also uses 1.5mm printed spacers to get to 18mm in between the plates to match the printed pieces.
  - Alternatively, you can get the [spacers](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/metal_micron/blob/main/DXF/Optional%20Alternative%20Parts/Plate_Spacers_%5Bx12%5D.dxf) cut from 0.063"/1.6mm 5052 and just accept the 0.2mm of extra space that should go away when tightening down the fastners.
