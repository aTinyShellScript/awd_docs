# Printed ABAB Drives

This is an available option for those who hate front tensioners or otherwise don't think they need the additional heatsinking provided by metal plates.

## Printed Parts
* The printed parts are listed in the STL directory of the GitHub repo under either [STL/NEMA14/Printed](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/v2.4_AWD/tree/main/STLs/NEMA14/Printed) or [STL/NEMA17/Printed](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/v2.4_AWD/tree/main/STLs/NEMA17/Printed) depending on your stepper size. 

## All Wheel Drive
The NEMA14 and NEMA17 versions share the same BOM.
