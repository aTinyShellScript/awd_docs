# aTinyShellScript's v2.4 AWD Mod Documentation

So you want to go fast? or maybe you just hate front tensioners?

## Getting Started

The docs are split between material, metal or plastic, but there are shared pieces between both.

* `Metal Plates`
* `Plastic Plates`
* `Shared Pieces`

## Still Have Questions?

You can find discussion about this mod in the [Armchair Engineering Discord](https://discord.gg/armchairengineeringsux). There is a thread in `user-projects`.
