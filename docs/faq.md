# Frequently Assumed Questions That I Haven't Yet Been Asked

* Are there any big changes besides the obvious?
    * Yes, your rear AB motors will change which belt they're connected to. This is to keep compatibility with stock XYjoints. (This is not true of 2WD)

* Who actually needs to do this?
    * People who are sad they didn't build an Annex printer or otherwise hate money.

* Can I see your IS graphs?
    * No because my printers are in pieces and I didn't save the images. Coming soon-ish.

* Can I mod this?
    * Yes, please do it. The [CAD is available in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/aTinyShellScript/v2.4_AWD/tree/main/CAD).

* I can't CAD and need help with how to assemble this, can you help?
    * Time to learn how to look at CAD files! You can ask for help on the Armchair Engineering discord channel if you really get stuck.

* Why aren't there assembly instructions?
    * Because I have a near-zero attention span.
